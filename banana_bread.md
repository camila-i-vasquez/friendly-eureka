# Banana Bread 
## Basically the same recipe from [banana bread](https://frogprincepaperie.com/best-banana-bread-recipe-with-sour-milk/), but with weights

## Ingredients
- 114g butter
- 200g sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 3 mashed bananas 
... freezing brown bananas and crushing them in the bag makes life much easier :blush:

- 1/2 cup buttermilk or sour milk
... can make sour milk with 1 tablespoon vinegar-let curdle. 

- 250 g AP flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup nuts (or chocolate chips) (or any add-in that you want)

## Process
1. pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. 
2. Cream butter and sugar, mix in wet ingredients(eggs, banana, vanilla, milk)
3. Combine dry ingredients with wet ingredients, mix. 
4. fold in add-ins.
5. Pour into pre buttered-and floured (loaf pan, if making a loaf)
6. Bake! 
...baking time really depends on the thing you're baking in:
     - muffins get about 30 minutes
     - according to website, original recipe, a loaf will get about 70 minutes. 
     - update: baking a single loaf can take as long as 2 hours.
